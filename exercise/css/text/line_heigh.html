        The purpose of a paragraph is to express a speaker’s thoughts on a
        particular point in a clear way that is unique and specific to that
        paragraph. In other words, paragraphs shouldn’t be mixing thoughts or
        ideas. When a new idea is introduced, generally, a writer will introduce
        a new paragraph.
